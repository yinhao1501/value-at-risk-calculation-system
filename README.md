# Value at Risk Calculation System
This is a project I wrote for a graduate-level financial risk management course.There are three steps:

## Step 1
Implemented EWMA model to estimate daily volatilities of USD-MXN exchange rate returns from 2015 to 2017.

## Step 2
Introduced Monte Carlo simulation, parametric and historical methods to calculate one-day VaR of Mexican peso.

## Step 3
Back-tested VaR model for accuracy at different confidence levels using Chi-Square goodness-of-fit test.
